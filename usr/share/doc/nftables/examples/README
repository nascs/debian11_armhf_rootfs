These are some examples of the nftables syntax.

You may find example configurations for different families and operations (nat,
filter, mangle).

Also, you may find concrete configurations models, for example a simple
ruleset for a workstation.

For up-to-date information about syntax and usage, head to the official
wiki at: http://wiki.nftables.org
